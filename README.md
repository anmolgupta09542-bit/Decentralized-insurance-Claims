# 🛡️ Decentralized Insurance Claims

## 📌 Project Description
Decentralized Insurance Claims is a blockchain-based smart contract system designed to manage insurance claim submissions, approvals, and rejections without relying on centralized authorities. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, this system ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness in claim processing.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The vision of this project is to transform traditional insurance processes by removing intermediaries and enabling trustless, automated, and transparent claim management. Users should be able to submit claims confidently, knowing they cannot be tampered with or unfairly handled.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Submit Claims:** Users can submit claims with descriptions and requested amounts.
- **Transparent Processing:** All claims are stored publicly on-chain.
- **Role-Based Access:** Only the insurer (contract owner) can approve or reject claims.
- **Event Logging:** Emits events for submissions, approvals, and rejections.
- **Immutable Records:** Claim history is permanently recorded on the blockchain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Automated claim approval using decentralized oracles.
- Integration with real-world insurance platforms.
- Support for multiple insurers and policy types.
- Token-based incentives for honest claim validation.
- Mobile-friendly dApp frontend for user interactions.
